Welcome to Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages
Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages is a skill path that covers the skills professionals use to develop websites from scratch. For the duration of this program, you’ll take Codecademy lessons, complete projects on and off-platform, and complete quizzes to test your knowledge along the way. You’ll also build a series of professional websites modeled after realistic freelance projects. These projects will prepare you to build websites on your own.

Read the remaining information in this section to make sure you’re set up!

What You’ll Build
Throughout your Codecademy skill path, there will be many opportunities to practice what you’ve learned. While there will be many smaller projects along the way, the following projects will provide a more cumulative experience and help you build up your portfolio.

Dasmoto’s Arts and Crafts - this appears in the unit about building websites on your own computer.
Tea Cozy - this appears in the advanced CSS unit.
Colmar Academy - this is the capstone project at the very end of this skill path.
